# twst-wiki-parser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/myang5/twst-wiki-parser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/myang5/twst-wiki-parser)

A simple formatter that takes in translators' dialogue and converts it into source code for a new page on the Ensemble Stars wikia. Understanding and uploading the wiki code shouldn't be a roadblock for translators to share their hard work!

This project uses a modified version of the Chrome Picker from [React Color](https://github.com/casesandberg/react-color).

Note to self: Travis CI will handle building and deploying on PR, don't need to do it yourself
